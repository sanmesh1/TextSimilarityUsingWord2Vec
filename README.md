# Google Colab implementation of item similarity using text mining

Implementation of finding similar items to a target item based on word embedding techniques on the item description. Application of finding similar items is strengthening forecasting for a target item by using data from related items.

### Usage

The main jupyter notebook that hosts the code is word2vecTest.ipynb . 

To clone the repo into google drive, in order to open the word2vecTest.ipynb in colab, follow the instructions in the google colab link here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i3WmqEx5-O9DTBCxzkPGvE3412cRznCm/view?usp=sharing .

Once the repo is cloned into google drive, you can open word2vecTest.ipynb and follow the instructions in the colab to run it.
