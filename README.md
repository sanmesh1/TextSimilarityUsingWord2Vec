# Google Colab implementation of item similarity using text mining

Implementation of finding similar items to a target item based on word embedding techniques on the item description. Application of finding similar items is strengthening forecasting for a target item by using data from related items.

Word Embedding part of code partially borrowed from https://github.com/v1shwa/document-similarity  .

### Usage

The main jupyter notebook that hosts the code is word2vecTest.ipynb . 

To clone the repo into google drive, in order to open the word2vecTest.ipynb in colab, follow the instructions in the google colab link here: https://github.com/sanmesh1/IntegratingClonedGithubRepoWithGoogleColabAndGithubControl/blob/master/CloneRepoIntoGoogleDrive_General.ipynb .

Once the repo is cloned into google drive, you can open word2vecTest.ipynb and follow the instructions in the colab to run it.

To just run git commands, run code in GitCommands.ipynb

### Requirements
